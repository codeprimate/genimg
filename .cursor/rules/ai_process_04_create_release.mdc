# Create Release Notes

Generate accurate release notes by verifying specification against implementation. Implementation is the source of truth. This is the final step in the systematic development workflow. **Output complete release notes as markdown in docs/releases/.**

## Required Context

**CRITICAL**: Load the specification document (created via ai_process_01) before beginning. This provides the requirements baseline for verification against actual implementation.

**Process Integration**: Final step in systematic development:
- ai_process_01: Creates specification document
- ai_process_02: Creates implementation plan from specification  
- ai_process_03: Executes implementation based on plan and specification
- ai_process_04: Generates release notes by verifying specification against implementation

## Core Principles

**Implementation Authority**: Code implementation is the definitive source of truth. When specification conflicts with implementation, document what was actually delivered.

**Relevant Content Only**: Include only sections with meaningful changes. Omit empty sections. Structure release notes based on actual changes implemented.

**User-Focused Communication**: Emphasize user value over technical details. Use clear, accessible language. Never reference specification documents in release notes.

## Execution Process

### 1. Load and Analyze Specification
- Load specification document from ai_process_01
- Extract planned features, improvements, and changes
- Identify expected user-facing functionality and behavior changes
- Note specified breaking changes or deprecations

### 2. Verify Against Implementation
- Cross-reference specification requirements against actual code
- Identify what was actually implemented vs. what was specified
- Note additional functionality beyond specification
- Document deviations from original specification

### 3. Assess Implementation Reality
- Use code inspection to verify functionality
- Check available tests for validation evidence
- Identify actual breaking changes in APIs or behavior
- Measure actual performance improvements from implementation
- Analyze actual dependency updates and impacts

### 4. Filter Relevant Content
- Determine which release note sections contain meaningful changes
- Group implemented changes by type and user impact
- Prioritize user-facing changes over internal modifications
- Focus on changes that affect users or system behavior

### 5. Generate Release Notes
- Extract version from project configuration (pyproject.toml, etc.)
- Structure findings using template below
- Document only what was actually delivered
- Provide clear upgrade instructions based on implementation

## Release Notes Template

Use this structure, including only sections with actual changes:

```markdown
# Release v[VERSION] - [RELEASE_DATE]

## Overview
[Brief summary of release focus and major themes]

## 🚀 New Features
- **[Feature Name]**: [User-focused description of what this enables]

## 🛠️ Improvements
- **[Improvement Area]**: [Description of enhancement and user impact]

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **[Issue Area]**: [Description of problem solved and user impact]

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **[Breaking Change]**: [Clear description and migration guidance]
  - *Migration*: [Step-by-step update instructions]
  - *Affected*: [What users/use cases are affected]

## 📦 Dependencies
- **Updated**: [Dependency] from [old version] to [new version]
- **Added**: [New dependency] for [purpose/feature]
- **Removed**: [Removed dependency] (replaced by [alternative])

## 🔧 Developer Experience
- **[Development Area]**: [Changes affecting developers using this project]

## 📚 Documentation
- **[Documentation Area]**: [Significant documentation updates]

## 🏗️ Internal Changes
- **[Technical Area]**: [Internal improvements affecting stability/maintainability]

## 📊 Statistics
- **Commits**: [Number] commits since v[PREVIOUS_VERSION]
- **Contributors**: [Number] contributors
- **Files Changed**: [Number] files modified

## 🙏 Contributors
Thanks to contributors who made this release possible:
- @[contributor1]
- @[contributor2]

## 🚨 Upgrade Instructions
1. [Step-by-step upgrade instructions]
2. [Configuration changes required]
3. [Migration steps for breaking changes]

## 📝 Notes
- [Additional notes, known issues, or future plans]
```

## Content Guidelines

**Language Style**:
- Lead with user benefits: "You can now..." not "Added support for..."
- Explain impact: "This improves performance by 40%" not "Optimized algorithm"
- Provide context: "Previously, users had to... Now you can..."
- Use active voice and direct language
- Never reference specification documents

**Accuracy Requirements**:
- Verify version numbers and dates against project configuration
- Confirm breaking changes through code analysis
- Validate performance claims with implementation evidence
- Document only changes present in actual implementation

**Content Focus**:
- Prioritize user-facing changes that are actually implemented
- Include internal changes only when they meaningfully affect users
- Omit sections without substantial changes
- Focus on functionality that impacts user workflows or system behavior

## Success Criteria

Release notes must:
- Accurately reflect implementation reality over original specifications
- Focus on user value and practical impact
- Include only relevant sections with meaningful changes
- Provide clear upgrade guidance based on actual implementation
- Use accessible language without referencing specification documents

**Validation**: Ensure every item in release notes corresponds to actual implemented functionality verified through code inspection.

Execute systematic verification of specification against implementation reality and generate user-focused release notes documenting delivered functionality.
